# Abstract
The key of zero-shot learning is how to find the information
transfer model for bridging the gap between image and semantic
information (text or attributes). In the zero-shot classification,
exiting methods usually construct the compatibility function between
image and class embedding with the consideration of the manifold
structure on the semantic information class. However, the manifold
structure of image classes is also very important for the compatibility
model construction. Because it is difficult to extract the manifold
structure of image classes due to unseen classes, the manifold structure
of image classes often is ignored for zero-shot classification. To
utilize the manifold structure of image classes for complementing the
manifold structure on the semantic information class, we propose
structure propagation (SP) for improving the zero-shot classification. SP
can jointly consider the relationship of image classes (the manifold
structure of the image class) and the relevance of semantic classes (the
manifold structure of the semantic information class). Moreover, the SP
can describe the constrain relation between the compatibility function
and the manifold structure for balancing the influence of the structure
propagation iteration. The SP solution provides not only the zero-shot
classification label but also the relationship of two manifold structures
that encode the positive transfer in structure propagation.
